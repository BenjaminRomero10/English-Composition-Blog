            Although values are taught to us at first in our homes, ethics are
            learned in study, in experiences, at school, institute or
            university. These ethical values are what will define us as people
            when working or acting together with another person or company.
            Learning ethics has a value beyond <b>"being a good person"</b>, it
            is about knowing how to act in different cases, and it is about
            doing the morally correct thing, where all parties benefit, without
            affecting each other. Nowadays, students do not pay attention to
            moral ethics classes or they find it boring, that is why this blog
            will present tips to make classes more entertaining, so that our
            students understand the importance of ethics in cybersecurity
          </p>
          <p>
            In this blog we will focus on the principles to engage students in
            cybersecurity ethics courses, guided mainly by the article by
            Bustard (2018) in the United Kingdom, analyzing them and giving
            examples of how to apply them in daily classes.

          <h4>
            Principles for promoting engagement in cybersecurity ethics classes
          </h4>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, there are certain principles for engaging
            students in these ethics courses, specifically ethics in
            cybersecurity, which consist of (1)
            <b>matching the learning content to the tastes of the students</b>,
            (2)
            <b
              >taking a pragmatic rather than a philosophical approach to issue
              resolution</b
            >, (3) <b>explore all the complexity in real-world case studies</b>,
            and (4)
            <b
              >present the content in a way that the student finds
              entertaining</b
            >
            (Bustard, 2018).
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, I believe that these requirements are necessary today to
            form classes with greater harmony when it comes to learning, since
            they prioritize the fact that students feel that the content is
            closely aligned with the subject field.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cybersecurity expert should focus on minimizing risks and
            maximizing benefits, looking for vulnerabilities and not taking
            advantage of them, but reporting and helping to improve them. The
            point of this type of ethical course is for future professionals to
            adopt this way of working, therefore every good professional should
            give the same importance as any other learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we will go into depth with each of the principles proposed
            above.
          </p>

          <h4>
            1. Matching the learning content to the tastes of the students
          </h4>
          <p>
            It refers to aligning or selecting content relevant to the interests
            of the student. One of the ways to increase student engagement is to
            find interesting content for them. It is normal for a student not to
            see cybersecurity ethics classes as entertaining when they do not
            fully know what topics it covers, therefore they ignore it by saying
            "Why should I study this if I am an ethical person?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is understandable that not all students share the same tastes
            among themselves, however there is always a topic in trend, which
            can be used to align it with a topic of study for the course.
          </p>
          <p>
            A clear example of this would be to take advantage when a theme of
            magicians becomes trending and they could be aligned with the
            colored hats that represent the types of cybersecurity specialists
            that exist, as presented in Formosa, Wilson & Richards (2021):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            ...can be undertaken internally within an organisation or externally
            by authorised cybersecurity firms (white hat), by unauthorised
            hackers seeking bug bounties and other rewards without intending to
            harm organisations (grey hat), and by hackers seeking to damage
            organisations and exploit vulnerabilities (black hat) (p. 7).
          </blockquote>

          <h4>
            2. Taking a pragmatic rather than a philosophical approach to issue
            resolution
          </h4>
          <p>
            Student learning should be derived more from examples than from
            theory. Cybersecurity ethics courses are created for the purpose of
            the student understanding and applying them in their working life,
            but it can become complicated by not knowing how to do it
            specifically. This is where examples come into play. To make it more
            interactive, you can even do a role dynamic, so that the students
            put themselves in the place of the character.
          </p>
          <p>
            As much as today's youth are attached to technology, they are not
            aware of what a bad practice of ethics can cause or how to avoid
            being victims of it. One proof is the study carried out by Kalu,
            Chidi-Kalu, Okidi & Usiedo (2020) in Nigeria, where they questioned
            150 young people to answer questions regarding cybersecurity and
            lack of ethics, where they conclude that that the ignorance in young
            people about cybersecurity is enormous, despite becoming victims of
            it and being knowledgeable about new technologies, with which I
            agree with it. This is where ethics comes in and could help us avoid
            these frauds since with ethics there would be no people trying to
            steal information or access someone else's personal things. In
            addition, we also highlight the importance of knowledge in
            cybersecurity, although we do not want to give up in this field of
            work, it is always good to take into account some basic concepts
            that can help us avoid misfortunes in everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what a lack of practice causes, less effect in real life and
            more stress trying to memorize the theory
          </p>
          <div class="content-img-container-2"></div>
          <h4>3. Explore all the complexity in real-world case studies</h4>
          <p>
            Although we spoke before concentrating more on practice than on
            theory, it should be noted that practice, due to the very fact that
            it plays an important role when it comes to learning ethics in
            cybersecurity, must be based on real cases. We cannot continue
            giving cases where surreal things happen that will only happen 1 in
            1000 times.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to this, the case study must be comprehensive. This
            means that the case should not only be analyzed from an engineering
            point of view, but also from a political, social and even economic
            point of view in some cases. This is because when ethics is studied,
            regardless of whether it is in cybersecurity or in any other
            subject, we seek to make the student not only a better engineer, but
            also a better person. We can even see that ethics in cybersecurity
            does not have the same meaning in all fields, such as technology and
            social science, as Manjikian explains in a book review by Christen,
            Gordijn, & Loi (2020):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            ‘cybersecurity ethics’ itself has not actually meant the same thing
            to the two disparate audiences – technical practitioners and
            scholars in the social sciences... For a social scientist,
            cybersecurity is most often understood as a subset of national
            security concerns and therefore ethical, moral and legal questions
            are most often read within an existing set of understandings about
            national security and national security policymaking (p. 403).
          </blockquote>

          <h4>
            4. Present the content in a way that the student finds entertaining
          </h4>
          <p>
            As we have discussed in previous points, there is no better way to
            teach than with interactive dynamics, in which students can laugh,
            be entertained and learn at the same time. This is one of the many
            ways in which the student can better grasp the content to be taught
            by the teacher.
          </p>
          <div class="content-img-container-3"></div>
          <p>
            Of the different advantages of teaching in a way that students find
            fun, it can be highlighted that in this type of activity, in
            addition to learning better, links and contacts are formed between
            the teacher and the student, and where there are links , there is
            appreciation and where there is appreciation there is connection.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I hope these tips have been useful for future classes in
            cybersecurity ethics, since today's youth have to understand the
            importance that this topic has in their professional and personal
            development. They are the future of our planet and we have to make
            sure that their teaching is of quality and with memorable memories,
            thank you very much!
